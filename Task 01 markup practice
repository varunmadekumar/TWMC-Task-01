#How Direct Air Capture is a Climate Action Tool#

**Climate Action has been growing as a social ideology since 2015.** The Sustainable Development Goals were released back then, and the 13th (SDG 13) of them is Climate Action. 
***SDG 13*** aims to promote among us the intent to protect our planet. 
Five targets are stipulated under SDG 13, of which one is to build capacities to meet climate change. 
Direct Air Capture (DAC) has since been a prospective addition to the world’s climate action arsenal. 

DAC’s Present Performance Status

DAC, though a work in progress for around a decade, has received the spotlight now in the recent past. It is a radical thought to collect the Carbon dioxide that we emit from the air, as we are dealing with the subtle workings of our environment. As a result, apparatus has been devised to perform this task by engineers with peer-reviews on the feasibility. 
The idea has since grown promising and is suggested as necessary for mining activities. Fossil fuel extraction industries in some countries have already set up DAC facilities. Some industries in the USA, Canada, and Europe have come up (have emerged). However, We need plenty more across the world, which has economic and residual environmental impacts of the DAC apparatus. Having said that, DAC has proved to be a successful area of Climate Action. Carbon Engineering is one such company, in the field for over a decade.
Besides, the DAC system has encouraged many multinationals to invest in more plants. The likes of Microsoft, Stripe, Shopify, and Swiss Re have already contributed. Such companies have prioritized carbon neutrality ever since the pandemic’s first wave lopsided the global economy. United Airlines is willing to become carbon neutral by 2050 and continues investment in DAC. Some programs have also funded the DAC production. The X-Prize opened a competition for carbon removal ideas which will be funded US$100 million by 2025. Breakthrough Energy’s Catalyst Program is another. 
Private and public sectors have honed the DAC idea which encouraged governments to decarbonize our world with it. The US Department of Energy invested US$22 million in developing DAC systems. The investment increased by US$2 million in the following year. The government of the UK too announced an invested GBP100 million for carbon removal in 2020.
The DAC systems are certainly proving costly to implement in many nations, but agencies and governments are increasingly supporting the idea, which seems like a necessary step.
