### ***Bloom your floors, heal yourself*** ###
Houses today can be equipped with nature’s healing energy despite insulating people from the earth. Bits of the earth can cover the floors in the desired spots and patterns. Earthing the human body is a revitalizing experience , encouraging people to walk more on the earth barefoot. Connecting constantly with the earth’s elements passes nature’s electric charges through the body, which increases blood circulation, relieves stress, and reduces pain and inflammation3. 

Using carpet moss is a tradition. Beds and pillows are stuffed and mats are filled with it. Leaflets of the moss are placed in between stone and pebble collections in the backyards and walkways, where they grow up and cover the paths upon watering.

Yanko Design’s Bathroom Floor Mat embedded with the moss blooms to become bally, furry and grassy to walk on after refreshments. Bathrooms and gardens are the best fit for carpet moss. Spaces, where splashes and sprinkles of water are abundant, help the moss to stay wet for good growth. You can do it yourself with Yanko Design’s Carpet Moss which equips your personal spaces with eco-friendly healthy hotspots to walk on.

Yanko Design’s Carpet Moss uses Plastozote plant cells and moss leaflets to make the mat. Alternatively, the installation guide’s item list is also affordable to purchase and simple to assemble. In a tiny budget, earthing of the body hacks the healing hormones, busting the stress with the right cortisol levels. Carpet moss mats are effortless to install, themselves becoming a stress-buster.

### ***Assembling the carpet*** ###

***Step 01*** **Choosing the right location**

Carpet moss doesn’t grow without water. Thus, they fit best in wet indoor spaces and the outdoors. They can also take innovative locations like the planter boxes on the window sills and verandah floors. 

***Step 02*** **Plastozote planter cells** 

Plastazote is a sheet of imputrescible foam, which is patterned with tiny troughs for the moss leaflets to grow in. Plastazote is the preferred choice as it is used in prosthetics, being non-toxic for the skin. The sheets are available in standard sizes with the edges having grooves for attaching with adjacent sheets. Like a jigsaw puzzle, many such sheets can cover the desired square footage on wet floors and open yards.

***Step 03*** **Mesh covered with carpet moss (optional)**

As an alternative to plastazote, sheets of mesh can be stuck to a cloth floor mat that can retain moisture when wet. The mesh can be sprinkled with moss and tied to the mesh with plastic strips. When used with the plastazote cells, mesh sheets can be cut into the shapes of the cells and placed inside for better grounding of the moss when it grows.

***Step 04*** **Watering and growing** 

Once the elements are assembled, occasional watering of the moss can help it blossom within two weeks typically. It can be watered to the ease of the user’s remembrance along with the water splashes during bathroom occupancy. Irregular watering suffices since carpet moss’ specialty is growth with the supply of low CO2 and light.

Yanko Design is a design magazine that reviews and publishes news about products, design and tech. I have assumed the Carpet Moss mat to be a product by Yanko Design for the sake of the assignment’s convenience and have used resources from theie website. The carpet moss is an original idea of Nguyen La Chanh.
